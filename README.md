# Hedera Watch Party

This project is a consumer of the now defunct Ledger Works Sentinel project. It was originally designed to allow NFT and Token creators to display a live stream of sales of their NFTs and tokens.

## Features

- **Mint Mode:**
  Displays the number of NFTs left during mints to entice sales.

- **Trade Mode:**
  Shows each trade in a formatted display with details such as buyer, seller, and transaction amount.

- **NFT Messages:**
  Each message features images and detailed sale information.

- **Integrations:**
  - **Hashpack Naming Service:**
    Displays Hedera domain names (e.g., .hbar, .h) for better user recognition.
  - **Saucer Swap:**
    Retrieves and displays liquidity pool names.
  - **NFT Tier:**
    Provides rankings for NFTs.

## Usage

- This project relied on Ledger Works Sentinel, a service that no longer existed. Future support is unlikely.
